# Audit-alerts

On the 2nd day of each month, we used to receive Avis servers a bunch of text files with a lot of information within. It may seem an ancient technique, but at least is was functional. In the file destined for the audit department, there was a lot of extra text, characters and information that I did not need. Therefore, a script which would trim the extra text would be a perfect solution to save some precious time. After the script run, the final result was passed to the desired e-mail recipient and also inserted in a database. Furthermore, the info proccesed by this script was interpreted with the second script "Rental Contracts Audit".
